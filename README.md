# GeoSpectre AI Assistant

**GeoSpectre** is an AI-powered geospatial assistant that provides interactive maps and actionable insights for:
- Flood Risk
- Fire Danger
- Elevation Analysis
- Farming Suitability
- Population Density

It uses **real satellite and terrain data** from OpenTopography and other sources.

## Features

- Real-Time Satellite Integration via OpenTopography API
- Flood Risk Mapping using elevation and rainfall factors
- Fire Danger Analysis based on terrain and temperature
- Elevation Visualizations with heatmaps and contours
- Farming Suitability Checks for specific regions
- Population Density & Urban Planning Insights
- Conversational AI Interface with natural language queries
- Interactive Maps rendered with Folium and Streamlit

## Core Functionalities

### Chat-Driven Analysis
Example prompts:
- "Show me flood risk areas in Kerala with rainfall data"
- "Create a fire danger map for California forests"
- "Find best farming areas in Punjab"

### Data Fetching
- Fetch DEM (Digital Elevation Model) via OpenTopography API
- Generate synthetic elevation if real DEM is unavailable

### Risk Analysis
- **Flood Risk**: Based on elevation & rainfall factor
- **Fire Danger**: Based on elevation & temperature factor

### Map Rendering
- Folium-based heatmaps and circle markers
- Risk-level color codes with interactive popups and legends
